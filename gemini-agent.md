# Weza Space - Agent Rules & Memory

## 🛠️ Development Rules
1. **Server Management**: Always terminate any running local server (localhost) before checking status or restarting to avoid port conflicts.
2. **Routing System**: The project must function as a Single Page Application (SPA). Switching between Arabic and English should NOT open new HTML files or change the URL to different files. Everything should be routed dynamically within the main `index.html`.
3. **Folder Structure**: 
    - `src/css/`: All stylesheets.
    - `src/js/`: All logic and routing.
    - `src/assets/images/`: All visual assets.
    - `pages/`: Templates or components (to be fetched or injected).

## 🧠 Project Context
- **Client**: Islam (Kings of Fishes).
- **Tech Stack**: Node.js, Vite, Vanilla JS, Vanilla CSS.
- **Port**: 3000.
